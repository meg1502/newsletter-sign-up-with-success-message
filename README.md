## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This project reinforced the importance of clear separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to:
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming.
- Implement client-side form validation using JavaScript and Regular Expressions.
- Dynamically toggle UI states (signup vs. success) without page reloads.
